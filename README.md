## Project Objective
In all three of its locations, the Nigerian manufacturing company The Palmoria Group is dealing with problems related to gender imbalance. The headline "Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy" appeared in the headlines recently, which is regrettable. Given their desire to expand their company to other countries, this doesn't bode well for the business owners. Cases like this can only worsen, exposing additional problems like the gender pay gap among other potential problems. In other to get ahead of any suprises the HR Analyst was charged with identifying potential issues in the gender distribution across the company that can lead to damaging consequences.
Objectives
✔ What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to 
  regions and departments
✔ Show insights on ratings based on gender
  Analyse the company’s salary structure. 
  ✔ Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the 
  department and regions that should be the focus of management
✔ A recent regulation was adopted which requires 
manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of 
$90,000
  ✔ Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
✔ Show pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of 
   $10,000. For example: How many employees fall into a band of 
   $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000 etc. Also visualize this 
   by regions
✔ calculate the amount to be paid as bonus to individual 
   employees
✔ Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees 
  (salary inclusive of bonus)
✔ Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide
